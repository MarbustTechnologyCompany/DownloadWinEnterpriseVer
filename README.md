# DownloadWinEnterpriseVer

## Purpose
This repository serves as a guide on how to download the ISO for Windows 10/11.

## Steps:
1. Copy the files `run.bat` and `mediacreationtool.exe` to the root directory of any Windows drive, for example: `C:` or `D:`.
2. Run `run.bat` as an administrator.
3. The Media Creation Tool will open, requesting the Windows Enterprise license you have purchased (For intellectual property reasons, we do not provide any licenses).
4. Follow the steps to generate the ISO, and you're done.
